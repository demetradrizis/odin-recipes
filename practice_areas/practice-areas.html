                <h1>Helping Fathers With Child Support Issues</h1>
                <p>
                    As a father, you want to ensure that your child has everything they need to be happy and successful.
                    In divorce settlements, the father is often required to pay child support to ensure that the child
                    continues living the lifestyle they are used to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, no matter how willing you are to pay child support, working with an experienced child
                    support attorney is still essential to ensure that the process is fair. Financial records can be
                    misinterpreted, and you may be taken advantage of and end up paying way more than is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Divorce For Men, we advocate aggressively for fathers’ rights in Florida and for fathers seeking
                    child support. No man should become financially unstable just trying to provide for his child. Our
                    experienced child support attorneys work with fathers to ensure fair treatment and that their
                    children receive the support they actually need.
                </p>
                <h2>Getting You And Your Child What You Need</h2>
                <p>
                    Under Florida law, the mother and the father are both considered when determining child support. However, this isn’t always the reality that many fathers face. Often, the father is left paying child support calculated based on the child’s needs and the parent’s abilities and resources.
                </p>
                <p>There are many considerations that are taken into account for child support payments, including:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Available income of each parent</li>
                    <li>Whether the child spends more time with one parent</li>
                    <li>Education and health care needs</li>
                    <li>Lifestyle expenses of the child</li>
                    <li>Health insurance and other direct payments</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Our experienced child support attorneys can help ensure that the calculations are based on accurate information and reflect your financial situation properly. If you have a former spouse who is unwilling or unable to contribute to your child’s care and maintenance, we can help aggressively pursue your case so that you and your child get what you need.
                </p>
