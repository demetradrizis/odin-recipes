                Divorce for Men is a boutique law firm focusing in protecting fathers’ rights and the rights of their children. We specialize in the practice of family law. Unfortunately, this sometimes includes domestic violence injunctions and domestic battery. Our firm’s approach is to minimize the pain and costs (emotional and financial, both present and future) of a divorce. This is accomplished through our experience.
            </p>
            <p class="p2" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 50px;">
                Divorce for Men was established by Alan Rosenthal in 1998. We have handled more than 4,000 cases since then with our clients receiving the benefits from our experience.

            <p class="p2" style="width: 75%;">
                Being the son of Greek immigrant parents, he learned the necessity of hard work, the determination to succeed, and how to overcome adversity. His upbringing taught him the importance of family values and a strong work ethic, both of which he carries over into his practice of law.
            </p>
            <p class="p2" style="width: 75%;">
                Attorney Drizis notes that he is not only the owner of Divorce for Men, but is also a member. He formed Divorce for Men after his own divorce in 2001. He is now a divorced father who is happily part of a blended family. Because of his own experiences dealing with divorce, he understands the pain it can cause families.
            </p>
            <p class="p2" style="width: 75%;">
                That’s why he is here to provide the necessary counseling and support. As a former state prosecutor he participated in over 55 jury trials under his belt, he can protect the rights of you and your children.
            </p>
            <p class="p2" style="width: 75%;">
                Due to attorney Drizis’ divorce, he was financially forced to leave his position as Assistant State Attorney, for the Office of Bernie McCabe, where participated he was a Lead Trial Attorney and participated in over 50 jury trials. As a divorced father of two girls, Hali Ann and Demetra Marie he understands the pain of divorce, but also understand that there is life after divorce. He is remarried to Mary Beth and has added three more children to his life, Jen, Brandon and Zach, forming a new blended family. This personal and legal experience allows attorney Drizis to better understand his client’s wants and needs.
            </p>
            <p class="p2" style="width: 75%;">
                Upon leaving the State Attorney’s office he was on the Pasco County Felony Court Appointed list where he defended all types of cases. He is a member of the Florida Bar, U.S. Federal District Court, Middle District, Clearwater Bar Association, West Pasco Bar Association, and Past President of the Pinellas County Trial Lawyers and current mentor. He also attends Generation Christian Church, and Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church.

                <p class="p2" style="width: 75%;">
                    Irene credits her work ethic, family values and firm belief in the Orthodox Faith to her parents and grandparents and works to instill them in her home.
